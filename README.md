# Android Kotlin Fundamentals
This repository is for #30DaysOfKotlin, all applications and concepts I learnt from [Android Kotlin Fundamentals](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/overview) Codelabs.
I also draughted some of the important points I found, you can check the notes my clicking [here](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s672/sh/6ec55366-19fb-4dd5-826d-a266801d00f7/8e2bd36a9a3c407b9f7fb8fc9bf7e0b3)
<br>{Notes are updated till lesson 4.1:  Lifecycles and logging}

## [Lesson 1: Build your first app](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/overview#lesson_1_build_your_first_app)

In lesson 1 I learnt how to set up Android Studio to use Kotlin and how to build apps. I started with "Hello World" and moved up to an app that uses image files and a click handler. I learnt how Android projects are structured, how to use and modify views in your Kotlin Android app, and how to make sure that our apps are backward-compatible. I also learnt about API levels and the Android Jetpack libraries.

## [Lesson 2: Layouts](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/overview#lesson_2_layouts)

In Lesson 2, I learnt how to use the Android Studio Layout Editor to create linear layouts and constraint layouts. I created apps that get and display user input, respond to user taps, and change the visibility and color of views. In this lesson I also learnt how to use data binding to eliminate inefficient calls to the findViewById() method.

## [Lesson 3: Navigation](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-create-and-add-fragment/index.html?index=..%2F..android-kotlin-fundamentals#0)

In Lesson 3, I learnt how to create useful navigation in an app. I created a fragment and added it to an app, then I added navigation to the app using the Android Studio navigation graph. I added a navigation drawer and an options menu to the app, and I worked with the app's back stack, changing the destination of the system Back button. Finally, I learnt how to invoke an external activity from within the app.
