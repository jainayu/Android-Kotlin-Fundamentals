# Android Kotlin Fundamentals
This repository is for #30DaysOfKotlin, all applications and concepts I learnt from Android Kotlin Fundamentals Codelabs.

## Lesson 1: Build your first app

In lesson 1 I learnt how to set up Android Studio to use Kotlin and how to build apps. I started with "Hello World" and moved up to an app that uses image files and a click handler. I learnt how Android projects are structured, how to use and modify views in your Kotlin Android app, and how to make sure that our apps are backward-compatible. I also learnt about API levels and the Android Jetpack libraries.

## Lesson 2: Layouts

In Lesson 2, I learnt how to use the Android Studio Layout Editor to create linear layouts and constraint layouts. I created apps that get and display user input, respond to user taps, and change the visibility and color of views. In this lesson I also learnt how to use data binding to eliminate inefficient calls to the findViewById() method.
